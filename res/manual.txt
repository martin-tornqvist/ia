2. Movement and interaction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can move in eight directions by using the numpad keys in this manner:

   7 8 9
    \|/
   4-5-6
    /|\
   1 2 3

The '5' key or period key (.) makes you wait for a turn.

You can also use the arrow keys for movement. To move diagonally using the arrow keys, hold shift or ctrl:
   Shift + left  = up left
   Shift + right = up right
   Ctrl  + left  = down left
   Ctrl  + right = down right

Page up, Page down, Home, and End can also be used for diagonal movement.

Vi keys (or "Rogue keys") are also supported:

   y k u
    \|/
   h-.-l
    /|\
   b j n

Certain things can be interacted with by moving into them (i.e. by "bumping" them), for example:
   * Move into enemies to attack them
   * Move into closed doors, chests, cabinets, etc to open them
   * Move into fountains to drink from them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. The interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is an example of what the interface lines can look like:

   HP:9/16 SP:8/8 Ins:45%/12% Exp:1(60%)    ) Sledgehammer 11.0 {+1} -15%
   Dlvl:2  W:40% [:1  %:Off(500) %:60       / 6 Throwing Knives 4.0 +10%
   Blind Diseased                                                         T:264

From left to right, the first line displays:
   * Hit Points (current/max - see "Hit Points, Wounds and healing")
   * Spirit Points (see "Spirit and spell casting")
   * Shock and Insanity (see "Insanity")
   * Character Level and remaining Experience Points until next level
   * Your wielded weapon (average damage with this weapon, weapon damage bonus,
     weapon accuracy modifier)

The second line displays:
   * Dungeon level
   * Encumbrance from carrying items (from 100% you move at half speed, and
     from 125% you cannot move at all)
   * Armor Points (each point reduces physical damage taken by 1)
   * Electric Lantern status (Off or On, and how many turns it can be used for)
   * Medical Bag Supplies (see "Hit Points, Wounds and healing")
   * Selected throwing weapon (stack size, average damage, accuracy modifier)

The third line displays properties currently affecting you. This can be temporary properties (e.g. from spells), permanent intrinsic properties (printed in capital letters, e.g. "CURSED"), or properties granted by wearing or wielding items.

To the far right on the third line, the current "standard" turn number is displayed. Note that depending on traits, items, etc, you may sometimes act more often, or less often, than this number is incremented. For example, if you move twice as fast as normal (+100% speed), you will only see the turn number increment on every second action you take.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Inventory handling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The inventory can be accessed in three ways:

   (1) Pressing "i" opens a full view of your inventory
Here, you can see all of your inventory slots (see below), and a complete list of your carried items. Selecting an inventory slot (with enter or a letter key), either puts away an existing item from the slot, or opens a list of items that you can equip in the slot.

To wear or wield items, they are placed in different inventory slots:
   * Wielded  - your currently used melee weapon or firearm
   * Prepared - the weapon to switch to when pressing "z"
   * Body     - item worn over your body (e.g. an armor or a jacket)
   * Head     - item worn on your head (e.g. a gas mask)

   (2) Pressing "a" shows only items which you can "activate" or consume
This is merely a convenience feature - you can just as well use items by selecting them from the "i" screen, but with this method you get a nice filtered list so you can see at a glance which consumables you have.

   (3) Pressing "T" opens a list to select an item for throwing attacks
The item currently used for throwing can be seen at the bottom right corner of the screen. To throw this item, press "t", aim somewhere with the movement keys, and press "t" again to throw it.

Note that explosives are used in a different way; first you must ignite or prime the explosive, this is done by "activating" it (can be done from the "a" inventory screen) - now see your character colored yellow as a warning that you are holding an ignited explosive (don't hold on to it too long). Press "t", and aim somewhere (the game will mark the area around your aim position to indicate the explosion size - be careful though, there may be unseen objects blocking the throw path). Press "t" again (or enter) to throw the explosive toward the aim position.

To drop an item, select the item while holding shift (i.e. shift + enter, or shift + letter). This can be done from any inventory screen. If you are dropping a stack of something (e.g. a number of Shotgun shells), the game will ask how many to drop, by letting you type in a number.

In any inventory screen, you can see percentage values to the far right of each item. This is how many percent of your total carried weight that each item takes (the numbers roughly adds up to 100%, but there will be rounding errors, since decimals are not shown). So if you are overburdened, an item with a high percentage value might be a good candidate to drop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Hit Points, Wounds and healing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The state of your physical health is described in two ways:

   (1) Hit Points (HP)
This represents minor wounds like bruises and sprains, and also general combat morale, fatigue, stance, etc. If your HP reaches 0, it means you received a killing blow, or the circumstances are such that you can no longer fight back (you are fallen, pinned or completely exhausted). Hit Points usually regenerate automatically over time.

   (2) Wounds
This represents more serious long-term damage, and is shown as a property at the bottom of the screen. Wounds are received when you take a high amount of damage in one hit. Each Wound reduces your fighting abilities, maximum HP, and HP regeneration rate.

There is an item called a "Medical Bag", which has a certain number of "supplies". When activated, it will either Sanitize an infection or treat a Wound.

When bitten or clawed by certain monsters, you can become Infected. You should treat the infection before it becomes a disease! It only takes a few turns and supplies.

Treating a Wound requires many uninterrupted turns, and uses up lots of supplies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Spirit and spell casting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to your physical and mental health, you have an "essence" - or Spirit - to preserve. If you lose all your Spirit, you are dead.

Your Spirit Points are shown like this:
   SP:Current/Max

You can learn spells by first casting them from manuscripts. Casting spells "naturally" (without manuscripts) will drain some of your spirit.

To cast intrinsic spells, press [x] to open a menu for selecting which spell to cast. In this menu you can see the Spirit cost per spell (the cost is a range of values, and the spirit drained is a random value in this range), and your skill level for each spell (Occultist characters can learn to cast spells at higher levels by picking certain traits).

When casting a spell, you will get a warning if the spell could potentially drain all your remaining Spirit. You can then press y/n to attempt casting or abort. Casting the spell in this situation is a gamble with death.

There are also other ways you can lose your Spirit, for example some monsters can drain your Spirit with their attacks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Insanity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"A few steps more, and our breaths were literally snatched from us by what we saw; so literally that Thornton, the psychic investigator, actually fainted in the arms of the dazed man who stood behind him. Norrys, his plump face utterly white and flabby, simply cried out inarticulately; whilst I think that what I did was to gasp or hiss, and cover my eyes. The man behind me - the only one of the party older than I - croaked the hackneyed "My God!" in the most cracked voice I ever heard. Of seven cultivated men, only Sir William Brinton retained his composure; a thing the more to his credit because he led the party and must have seen the sight first."-H.P. Lovecraft, "Rats in the Walls"

Certain events in this game affects the sanity and composure of your character. One of the main threats to your mental health are the various horrifying creatures that inhabit the game world. When inside your view, some creatures may cause a vague unease, while others are very disturbing to behold. Your mind also takes a hit when you use occult powers, carry weird artifacts, or stand in darkness, etc. Finally, there is a slow perpetual taxing of your mind from exploring and dwelling in this haunted dungeon.

Your state of Insanity is shown by two percentage values like this:
   Ins:X%/Y%

The X-value represents your current state of shock, stress and paranoia, while the Y-value represents your long term Insanity.

When various disturbing events occur, the shock value rises. When shock hits 100%, the following happens:
   * You react somehow (scream, laugh, faint, babble, gain a phobia...)
   * The shock value is restored a bit
   * Insanity rises

Each time you travel to the next dungeon level, your shock is restored (you have escaped the horrors above, and is bestowed with a sense of progress). Also, standing in a lit area reduces your shock a bit (most characters start with an Electric Lantern).

If your Insanity reaches 100%, you are hopelessly lost, and the game is over.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Sneaking and backstabbing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monsters unaware of your presence have a blue background on their map icon. This is their default mode. While in this state they may roam the map, but they will not actively search for you or purposefully attack you. If you attack an unaware opponent in melee, the attack gets a big bonus to damage and hit chance.

For each turn you spend in a monsters visual area (for monsters with sight), there is a chance that it will either completely detect you, or become "suspicious". While suspicious, the monster has an increased chance of detecting you (watch out for messages about monsters looking "wary" or "disturbed").

Some monsters have the ability to sneak as well. You automatically attempt to detect them while they are in your visual area.

The chances of one creature detecting another are affected by:
   * Search skill
   * The hidden actor's sneak skill
   * Light and darkness
   * Distance

You can improve the search and sneak skills with traits (e.g. "Observant" and "Stealthy").

When you stay out of an aware monster's vision for a certain number of turns (and nothing else alerts it), it will "forget" about you. The number of turns this takes depends on the monster; A simple animal may only care for a couple of turns after it loses sight, while a human will remain aware longer.

Monsters also react to noise, and may disturb nearby monsters when becoming aware, alerting them to your presence. Medium and heavy melee weapons will make noise on attacks, so a light weapon might be more ideal for a stealthy combat approach. Some sounds are louder than others, for example firing a gun or kicking down a door is likely to attract some attention.
