--------------------------------------------------------------
v19.2 *** WORK IN PROGRESS ***
--------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay
* All items which gave XP on identification now instead gives XP when that item is found for the first time (except "Strange Devices") - the reason for this is to reduce the pressure to identify consumables as soon as possible, and also to have a more "natural" continuous stream of XP, rather than occasional bursts
* When carrying a Potion, you eventually get a "feeling" for if the Potion is benign or malign
* Increased minimum distance from player when spawning monsters (when entering a new map, or spawning over time)
* Hounds can no longer bash doors
* Reduced group sizes of Hounds
* Hound bites cause physical damage instead of elemental (again) - this is to avoid players trivially becoming invincible against Hounds by casting the "Resistance" spell

* Invisible monsters causes shock (with a fixed amount), provided that the monster cannot be seen, and the player is aware of the monster ("!" sign on the map), and their map cell is seen
* The Spirit Dagger does 300% extra backstab damage (just like normal daggers)
* While the player is using the Medical Bag, infections cannot turn into disease, and the infection turn count is frozen
* Updated the score formula to include turn count (lower turn counts give higher scores), also a winning game now guarantees higher score than a non-winning game
* The Rod of Purge Invisible is now a Strange Device instead
* Nicer tombs are guaranteed to contain better items (and common tomes MAY contain better items)
* Pitchforks gives +15% chance to evade melee attacks

--------------------------------------------------------------
v19.1 (August 20, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay
* Spells have basic/expert/master tiers instead of a skill percentage - higher tiers can be achieved by picking traits for various spell domains (e.g. "Lesser Invocation" to cast all attack spells at expert level)
* Reworked the spell skill bonuses for all spells

* The spell "Healing" is now also available for the player

* Added spell "Transmutation" (convert items)

* Removed Potion of Clairvoyance
* The Potion of Invisibility effect ends when attacking or casting spells, and has much shorter duration
* Removed the "Sacrifice Life"/"Spirit" spells
* The spell "Summon Creature" picks more sensible monsters when cast by the player (e.g. a Wolf will not appear when cast at Master level)
* Improved AI of player allied  monsters - they are now much more active in pursuing enemies
* Added trait "Stout Spirit" (before "Strong"/"Mighty Spirit")

* Ravens, Bats, and Vampire Bats no longer actively moves towards the player, but will attack if adjacent
* Byakhees are slower
* Ghoul characters have +10% speed and +1 natural Armor Point
* "Infravision" has been changed to the ability to see in darkness instead (this means Ghoul characters can fully see in dark rooms)

* Poison damage is slower, but poisoning generally lasts longer
* XP gained from Monoliths increased from 15% to 20%
* Rod of Cloud Minds (which the Rogue starts with) now only requires 90 turns to recharge (or 45 with the Electrically Inclined trait)
* Unidentified Rods do not display their recharge countdown - attempting to use an unidentified Rod before it's recharged wastes a turn (with the same message as if the effect is unknown), but does not reset the countdown
* Removed the damage bonuses from the Marksman traits (it made ranged combat very overpowered)
* Removed Armor Points bonus from Tough/Rugged traits

* The War Veteran starts with a Flak Jacket instead of a Leather Jacket

* Greatly reduced the ability penalties for wearing Iron Suit, and slightly reduced the penalties for the other armors
* Putting on, taking off, or dropping armor now takes multiple turns
* Properties applied from monster attacks (such as paralyzation or blindness) have a certain percent chance to get applied - many attacks still have 100% chance to apply their effect, but some now have a lower chance (such as paralyzation from White Spider bites)
* Paralyzation can be re-applied while already active
* Paralyzed actors always have 100% speed, so that very fast monsters (such as  Bats) does not immediately start moving again
* Much higher chances that monsters become "wary" first, instead of immediately detecting the player
* When monsters detect the player due to sounds, they pause for one turn (just like they already did when detecting by vision)

* Added some new mid/late game monsters
* Weakening now causes halved melee damage, instead of minimum melee damage
* Removed the Wolves from the intro level
* The Rejuvenator Device causes heavy shock when used
* Good properties no longer interrupt player actions when they are applied (e.g. using medical equipment is not interrupted by regaining spell resistance)

Interface
* Weapon names show average damage instead of dice rolls - melee weapons also show their "plus" damage bonus (not including any damage bonus from traits), e.g. "Machete 9.0 {+2} +0%" - the exact dice rolls can be seen in the detailed item description when viewing the item in the inventory
* Brighter interface color scheme (some menus could be difficult to read before)
* The descriptions for armors and gas masks includes their exact ability penalty values
* Multiple monsters had a red "E" as symbol when playing in text mode, they now use different colors from each other
* "Ornate Tombs" are now colored cyan instead (they were hard to distinguish from normal tombs)
* When viewing monster descriptions ("v"), the monster's hit chances and properties are no longer displayed (only the player's chance to hit the monster)
* Fixed Fire Hound projectile animation in tiles mode (a small "blast" tile instead of a bunch of forward slashes)
* When walking through water or mud, more descriptive messages are printed ("I wade slowly through the knee high water") instead of "splash" or "glop" - this is to emphasize that they cost an extra turn to move through
* When not wearing armor, the armor icon is drawn slightly darker than before
* Ravens are brighter (they could be hard to see)
* The high score list now also shows player background
* A game summary text file is always stored after the game (there is no menu option for this)
* You now also go to the postmortem menu after winning the game, and a game summary file is written
* When browsing high scores, selecting an entry shows the game summary for that entry
* The game no longer pre-loads the ambient sound effects (they are now only loaded on demand) - vastly reducing the program load time (should be nearly instant on most systems) and initial memory usage
* Seeing fire on the map now interrupts actions such as waiting or using medical equipment

Bug fixes
* On some machines, the random number generator would have a fixed seed (apparently, the C++ std::random_device can silently fall back on this method if it cannot find a source of randomness...), resulting in deterministic map generation, etc - the RNG is now seeded with the current time instead
* Fixed a bug which prevented accessing the manual ("Tome of Wisdom") from the esc-menu during a game
* Fixed a bug which removed the Sentry Drone monster from the game - preventing both usage of the Sentry Drone device, and hostile Sentry Drones from spawning on the map
* When Mi-go commanders dropped their armor on death, this was treated as if the player tried to unequip the armor
* The "wall collapse" event could crash the game in some situations
* The descriptions of "fast" monsters said that they appear to move "slowly"
* Fixed some typos


--------------------------------------------------------------
v19.0 (July 20, 2017)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay
* You no longer gain XP from killing monsters - instead XP is raised by activities related to exploration and discovery, such as identifying items, drinking from some types of fountains, reading inscriptions on "monoliths", or seeing a new type of monster for the first time
* Fewer monsters are spawned on the map overall, and many monster types now tend to spawn in smaller groups, but are individually stronger - they also generally follow and remember you for a shorter time than before
* Monsters may become "suspicious" (typically with a message about them looking "wary" or "disturbed"), which gives them an increased chance of detecting you - they may still detect you immediately, but the chance for this is slightly lower than before
* Added metal doors - can only be opened with levers
* Added bookshelves - can contain Manuscripts
* Added barred gates - doors that can be seen and shot through
* Added gratings - walls that can seen and shot through
* Added "pylons" - can be activated with a lever for various effects (most commonly burning the area around them)
* Added hanging vines - can be walked through, but blocks line of sight
* Added rusty chains - makes a noise when someone walks through them
* Items are more likely to spawn behind hidden/stuck/metal doors, and in areas away from the path to the stairs
* Added a bunch of unique artifacts, and removed the old (relatively bland) randomized amulets
* If you are Observant, you now get "level feelings" when there are unique monsters or artifacts (when entering a new level, or when monsters appear on the map), such as "I feel like I should examine this place thoroughly"
* Standing in lit cells (e.g. lit by the Electric Lantern) now temporarily reduces your shock
* Some rooms are generated from handmade templates (loaded from a text file)
* The game now models creature speeds in a new (probably more common and intuitive) way - creature speeds are expressed as percentages, e.g. 50%, 100%, or 300%, and different actions can have different speeds
* Many bonuses such as "occasionally performing a certain action instantly", now simply gives a speed bonus instead (to a specific action, or to all actions)
* Dodging also applies to ranged attacks
* The spells Slow, Paralyze, and Terrify Enemies have been merged into "Enfeeble Enemies"
* The spells Detect Monsters, Detect Traps, and Detect Items  have been merged into "Searching" (which also detects doors)
* Burning features only hurt creatures on the same cell (not adjacent to it)
* "Cloud Minds" is a Rod instead of a spell (the Rogue starts with this item, intead of the spell)
* Spells have "skill level" percentages, which determines the strength of the spell (and can also add additional spell effects) - the skill levels are primarily increased by casting from Manuscripts
* All backgrounds can learn spells, but the Occultist gains proficiency much faster (and as before, starts with a few spells and has access to unique spell casting traits)
* Different monsters have different spell skill levels - spells cast by more powerful monsters will typically hurt more, last longer, summon nastier monsters, etc
* Monster spells have individual cooldown counters (instead of random chances to be cast) - so a monster cannot for example spam Darkbolt several turns in a row
* The Warlock trait gives a chance to cast damage dealing spell multiple times (instead of the old "Charged" mechanic)
* Added trait "Electrically Inclined" - gives bonus to using Rods, Devices, Electric Lanterns, and electricity weapons
* Added trait "Silent" - all melee attacks are silent, opening and closing doors does not alert monsters
* Added trait "Magically Gifted" - +20% skill with all spells
* The traits "Tough" and "Rugged" also grants 1 armor point each
* The War Veteran background also starts with the "Healer" trait
* The Occultist starts with fixed (non-random) items and spells
* When quaffing Potion of Insight, you can manually choose which item to identify
* Potion of Insight always gives some XP, in addition to identifying an item (to avoid making them worthless if all items are identified)
* All Manuscripts are guaranteed to be identified when read (previously this only applied to potions)
* You search for secret doors and traps a bit further away, and your chance of finding them is affected by distance - for adjacent cells there is now a higher chance of detection than before (to avoid requiring hundreds of turns to detect an obvious hidden door)
* Traps are always immediately revealed when triggered by the player
* Some melee weapons can be used for breaching doors or destroying corpses more effectively with [w] (check the item descriptions)
* Chests can no longer be trapped (it was awkward to deal with, and didn't really bring anything to the game) - chests are now interacted with merely by bumping them (if they are not locked), kicking them, or using an Opening spell
* Rogues remain aware of monsters much longer than the other Backgrounds, and the other Backgrounds remain aware for a shorter duration than before
* Removed the random "I have a bad feeling about this..." shock events
* The Iron Suit and Asbestos Suit no longer gives penalties to aiming or spotting hidden monsters and objects
* Removed all negative effects from critically failing melee attacks (such as "I am exhausted"), except for a small chance of the weapon breaking - which can only happen while cursed
* Added more monsters
* Zombie-type monsters occasionally drop "Zombie Dust" when they are destroyed - can be thrown at living, non-undead monsters to paralyze them
* Added property "Deaf", deafening traps, and a deafening spell (for monsters)
* When attacking invisible monsters who are immune to the attack, a message is printed to indicate this (previously it was only printed for seen monsters)
* Added Spiked Maces - a weapon with a weight between medium and heavy, and with a chance to stun the victim
* The Mi-go Electric Gun no longer uses ammo, and costs Spirit Points to fire

Interface
* The throwing slot has been removed - instead you change which item to use for throwing by pressing [T] (which can be a wielded item or an item in the backpack) - pressing [t] throws the currently selected item (this also has gameplay effects, since you don't have to spend turns to equip different items to throw them)
* While holding lit explosives, the explosive is shown in the status lines instead of the selected throwing item (with yellow text)
* All active properties are printed with descriptions on the [@] character decsription page, and when [v]iewing monsters
* When picking a trait, instead of showing all available and blocked traits in the same list, the trait selection screen now has two modes (toggled with [TAB]) - the first mode shows available traits, and the second shows traits for which the prerequisites are not yet fulfilled
* Reduced "more" prompt message spam from traps (less interruption)
* Addded option to enable/disable fading rendering brightness with distance from player
* Added an option to ask for confirmation before lighting explosives
* Added a low HP warning
* Removed the "q" command - Ghoul characters now feed on corpses when "waiting" on them instead
* The map shown on the postmortem info screen is drawn with tiles (if that mode is enabled), and in color
* Added "New journey" option to postmortem menu, to immediately start a new game
* When [v]iewing the map, the game also prints messages for cells with detected unseen monsters ("There is a creature here")
* When [v]iewing detailed monster descriptions, the game prints hit chances for melee, ranged, and throwing attacks for the player and the monster - with the calculations of the total hit chances shown
* Weapons now merely display their own hit chance modifier (e.g. +5% or -10%), instead of your skill plus the weapon modifier (the old way was misleading, since more factors are involved when calculating actual hit chances during attacks)
* Removed the "Combat skills" section of the character description page
* Messages are printed when stepping on corpses
* Sound effects are played when browsing menus
* When entering player name, the previously used name is filled in as a default name
* The player symbol is colored yellow when carrying a lit Electric Lantern

Bug fixes
* Fixed a bug where dropping the Staff of the Pharaohs would cause the spell to be permanently lost, even if the staff was picked up again
* Fixed a bug that prevented hit chance bonus against unaware targets for ranged attacks


--------------------------------------------------------------
v18.2 (July 2, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay
* All backgrounds (classes) now have ranged attack bonus vs unaware targets (not just Rogues)
* Ghoul characters are no longer shocked by Ghoul statues
* You no longer drop your items when you die
* Removed the "R" command to rearrange rounds between pistol magazines - this is now instead done when you wait (with "5", "s", or ".")
* Spider webs are now destroyed when the creature held is teleported away or knocked back
* Fire Hound bites now also causes Burning (like their ranged attacks)
* Slightly reduced the number of Medical Bag supplies

* Removed some redundant messages to reduce clutter ("I pause for a while...", "I stop waiting.")
* Added a section in the manual about inventory handling

Bug fixes
* Fixed a bug that caused monsters with Fear Resistance to end all player phobias when they spawned (this was mistakenly reported to the insanity system as a "player gaining permanent rFear" event)
* Fixed some buggy item drop code (which may have caused crashes)
* Fixed some minor bugs in the map generator (the map generator can also do a few new things now, although it's probably subtle)
* Fixed some errors in Manuscript names (underscores had snuck into a few names for some reason)
* Fixed a bug that (in some rare specific cases) allowed monsters to move into the position already occupied by another monster
* Fixed a bug were teleporting or being knocked back while held by a spider web, caused the web to be able to hold any creature that walked into it, regardless of monster type (e.g. ethereal monsters or spiders could then also be held)


--------------------------------------------------------------
v18.1 (Mars 17, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay
* Worms Masses may now only split once (i.e. the split worms may not also split themselves), they do not split if they are killed with enough damage, they are not allowed to attack immediately after being split, and the confusion effect from Mind Worm bites has a much shorter duration. However, Worms now move at normal speed (instead of slow).
* Gas Mask and Asbestos Suit now protects against blindness from Ravens, Spitting Cobras, and Dust Vortexes
* Vortex monsters no longer "explode" when they die
* Oozes can no longer regenerate HP while burning
* There is now much smaller chance of gaining multiple phobias, and you can never become both sadistic and masochistic at the same time
* Picking the Fearless trait immediately ends all active phobias
* When bashing or eating multiple corpses in the same cell, Zombie-type monsters are now prioritized (since you want to destroy them as soon as possible before they rise)
* You can now also kick in your own cell ("w", then "5" or ".") - to destroy corpses you're standing on
* You are no longer "telepathically"aware of where all allied monsters are - if they are out of sight or invisible, you can lose awareness of them
* You can now only accidentally drop your melee weapon during combat if you are Cursed

Interface
* Spells in the casting menu now appear in the order that you learned the spells (instead of alphabetically)
* On turns that you can walk for free due to Dextrous, the "T" is now colored green instead of the number (to be less distracting)
* Removed the "icon mode" which used a heart, brain, stopwatch etc as symbols in the user interface
* The message "I stop waiting" is no longer printed when fainting or paralyzed

Bug fixes
* Fixed some bugs in the monster movement AI (it wasn't anything critical, but it made them act a bit weird in a few specific situations)
* Fixed a faulty message when pressing "t" with no item selected for throwing (the message adviced to press "w" to wield a throwing weapon, but the actual key should be "i")
* Property messages such as "...is paralyzed" is no longer allowed for dead monsters


--------------------------------------------------------------
v18.0 (January 28, 2016)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay
* Added more monsters
* Added invisibility property
* Ghost-type monsters and Polyps are invisible.
* New Potions: Invisibility and See Invisible (can see all invisible and sneaking monsters, prevents blindness)
* Bumping an unseen monster (sneaking or invisible) that you are unaware of no longer performs a melee attack, instead it prints a message such as "There is someone here!", and makes you aware of the monster (you see it as a "!" on the map)
* New background: Ghoul
* New property: Infravision (the Ghoul background starts with this, and many monsters has it), which allows you to see infra-visible creatures in the dark
* Made several changes to how traps work - most importantly, when they activate there is usually a delay of a couple of turns from when they activate until the effect occurs - this means that you can (sometimes) avoid the effect by moving away from the trap
* Added command [R] for organizing Colt magazines (the game will reload your wielded or readied Colt, or move single rounds between magazines, whichever is better)
* Added command [N] to make noise (for luring monsters)

* Critical misses for melee attacks (1% chance normally) now cause various bad things to happen, such as becoming exhausted, or dropping the weapon

* Changed Potion of Antidote to Potion of Curing, which acts like a light version of Potion of Healing
* All Potions are now guaranteed to identify when you drink them
* Added new item class "Rods" - these are similar to Devices, except they never break or malfunction, and instead have a cooldown time before they can be used again
* The Wound system (which was removed in v17) is now back again - when you take heavy damage in one hit you receive a Wound - each wound reduces your fighting abilities, maximum HP, and HP regeneration rate - wounds can be healed with the Medical Bag

* Added Frenzy as an insanity symptom
* Braziers light up cells around them, and can be kicked over to do fire damage in a small area (similar to a small molotov explosion)

* In window mode, the window is created centered on the screen
* In some menus, options can now be selected directly with letter keys
* Page Up / Page Down can now be used in menus to jump to the top/bottom (if menu fits on screen), or to the previous/next screen (if menu takes up multiple screens)
* The [a] command is no longer a shortcut for Medical Bag and Electric Lantern, instead it opens a filtered inventory view only showing items which can be Applied (read, quaffed, activated, ignited, etc)
* Changed Inventory key to [i] instead of [w]
* [w] is now used for kicking/bashing instead of [q] (*Wham*)
* Intrinsic properties that lasts indefinitely are now spelled with upper case (e.g. you can be "DISEASED" or "Diseased"), to clarify that waiting will not end the effect
* Added an option for using symbols such as a heart for Hit Points, and a brain for Insanity in the interface (the old text based way is the default option)
* Reworked background and trait picking screens
* Removed the [D] command for jamming doors - instead using the "Close" command [c] on an already closed door will now attempt to jam it
* Removed uppercase [X] command, and instead made lowercase [x] bring up the spell selection menu (instead of re-casting previous spell)

* Fixed a bug that caused the player's dodge chance to be calculated the wrong way when Ghosts attempted to "touch" you
* If you ignited an explosive (Dynamite, Molotov, Flare, Smoke grenade) while already holding another, the first one would just be erased - now the game prevents you from igniting a new explosive instead
* Fixed a bug that prevented Flare Guns from burning the target
* Fixed a bug where bumping a hidden door would print a different message than bumping a wall (and thus indicating the presence of the door)


--------------------------------------------------------------
v17.0 (February 18, 2015)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay
* Monsters can now be allied to the player
* Added spell/manuscript "Summon Creature"
* The "Pestilence" spell now summons allied critters, and can be learned by both the player and monsters
* Renamed "Sentry Device" to "Blaster Device", and added a new "Sentry Drone Device" which will hover around you when activated and attack your enemies
* Added (rare) magic Amulets and Rings
* Added spell (and manuscript) of "Light" (illuminates the area around the caster for a number of turns)
* Added forest rooms

* Some of the old rooms are now occasionally cave shaped (e.g. flooded rooms and spider rooms)
* Added in-game descriptions for all items and spells
* Some items now causes ability penalties while used (e.g. the Iron Suite makes it more difficult to dodge) - all penalties are mentioned in the item descriptions
* A vast majority of the common fountains are now "refreshing" (restores HP, SPI and shock), many of the beneficial properties (RFire, RFear, etc) granted from fountains lasts twice as long. Golden fountains are much rarer than before and gives three effects (always beneficial).
* Some map features can catch fire, which can spread to adjacent cells over time
* Smoke causes blinding and choking
* Added Gas mask (the war veteran starts with one)

* Removed wounds - instead passive HP regeneration is now much slower, the Medical Bag can be used for restoring HP at a quick rate.
* Your inventory is no longer limited by the number of items (only by weight)
* Items can now exist on revealed traps (in previous versions, revealing a trap would "push" away any item to an adjacent cell, which was very annoying if you intended to pick up the item) - traps covered by an item are drawn with a background color corresponding to the trap type.
* You now start with a fixed number of items (instead of a random range), and your starting items depend more on the chosen background (e.g. the Rogue always starts with a +1 Dagger).
* Added trait "Summoner" - Reduced cost for summoning spells, and lower risk that called creatures are hostile
* Added trait "Vicious" - +50% backstab damage
* Added trait "Bane of the Undead" - +2 melee/ranged attack damage against undead monsters, attacks against ethereal undead monsters (e.g. Ghosts) never pass through them (although you can still miss in the ordinary way)
* Added trait "Unbreakable" - This is a continuation of "Tough"/"Rugged" (HP bonus, carry weight bonus, etc)
* The Electric Lantern now lasts a specific number of turns (displayed in the item name) instead of having a random chance per turn to break (but it can still randomly malfunction).
* Kicking a statue can cause it to topple over, damaging any monster behind it
* Doors no longer have a "broken" state - instead, breaking them simply converts them to "rubble"
* Brown Jenkin now does more melee damage, has very high sneak skills, and knows the teleport spell
* Added a bunch of new monsters
* The Mi-go Electric gun is now a "real" weapon that the Mi-go can drop, and can be used by the player - the Tesla Cannon has been removed (redundant). The "yellow cultists" now use the Mi-go Electric gun.
* Added Mi-go Biological Armor - this can be used by the player
* Monsters now drop all their items when they die (in previous versions, each item had 50% chance to be destroyed)
* Reworked how you interact with lootable features (chests etc). This is now a lot quicker - there is no need to search repeatedly with [a] (that command has been removed) - you use [d] to disarm/search for chest traps and check if the chest is locked, and you are either able to spot the trap or not (based on Observant/Perceptive traits) - searching repeatedly makes no difference. Attempting to disarm a known chest trap only either succeeds or triggers the trap, there is never any need to disarm repeatedly.
* When picking up Electric Lanterns or Medical Bags, those items are now combined with existing Lanterns/Medical Bags instead of adding a separate item in the inventory
* Removed insanity as a factor in score (it is now purely based on XP and dungeon level reached)
* Graves are no longer placed in the forest intro level for winning characters
* Firearms and thrown weapons have limited effective ranges, beyond which their damage is halved. When selecting target, the marker is colored orange beyond the effective range.
* Added phobia for darkness

Interface
* Added a quick move command [e], to automatically move in some direction until interrupted
* Removed the Inventory menu [i] and the Use menu [e] - instead you now view and handle your inventory from a single menu, accessed with [w].
* Removed the examine command [a]
* Added a shortcut key [a] to quickly activate the two most common items - Medical bag and Electric Lantern. When you press [a] the game asks if you want to use [a] Medical Bag or [e] Electric Lantern (perhaps in the future, shortcuts like these could be customized by the player).
* You no longer choose Medical Bag actions through a popup menu, instead it first sanitizes an infection if you have one, otherwise it restores HP.
* The "--More--" prompts now only accepts space or esc to proceed, this prompt is also added to more messages, for example triggering or avoiding traps - making it much easier to notice
* Changed the general color theme of the game's interface
* When viewing map cells with [v], information is printed for everything in that cell (not just the "top" thing) - e.g.: "I see here: A dart trap. A murky potion"
* Monster corpses are now included when viewing map cells with [v]
* Monster corpses are now referred to in more interesting ways, e.g. "A lifeless gruesome corpse" instead of "A body of a Reanimated Corpse"
* Monster corpses are now rendered in the same color as the living monster, making them easier to distinguish
* Adjacent dark cells are now rendered darker than normal cells to make it easier to notice darkness
* Walls now draw the front wall tile instead of the top tile if the cell below is unexplored
* Fountains are now either blue (common) or yellow (golden), then turns to gray when they are dried up
* Added more sound effects
* Number of turns left on the Electric Lantern is printed in the map screen interface (e.g. "L:498") - the number is printed with yellow color when the Lantern is lit
* Removed the status line at the bottom of the map that said "It is dark here" / "The darkness is lit up" (etc)
* Lit cells are no longer colored completely yellow - instead they are just colored slightly brighter (with more weight on yellow)
* The game no longer prints hit chance percent when aiming at ethereal monsters (this number was misleading)
* The graves in the intro level forest now also display the background of the characters
* Throwing explosives in tiles mode now draws the items tile instead of its ASCII character
* The game no longer draws/delays at each intermediate cell when creatures are knocked back (or pulled by a Vortex), only when the creature reach the "destination" cell - this feels more intuitive and responsive.

Bug fixes
* Fixed a bug that prevented backstabs from giving hit chance bonus in many cases
* Fixed a crash that occurred if enter was pressed while equipping a slot with no available items
* Fixed a crash that occurred if shift + enter (drop item) was pressed while a slot with no item was selected
* Fixed a bug that caused properties to "stick" on an item if it was dropped while wearing it (if the item was picked up again, the properties were enabled on the player even when the item was just carried in the backpack)
* Thrown objects may now pass through ethereal monsters (in the previous version, this rule mistakenly only applied to firearms and melee attacks)
* The Electric Lantern on/off state is now stored when saving the game
* Flying monsters can no longer be killed by kicking them into chasms
* The audio player now attempts to find a free channel, instead of just picking the next channel (this could stop other sounds, which frequently happened with long tracks like the ambient background noises)


--------------------------------------------------------------
v16.0 (April 17, 2014)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay
* You now pick traits when gaining character levels (as it was in v14) instead of only at the start. Many new traits have been added. You pick a trait each level, but the XP rate is roughly halved compared to older versions, and your character is limited to 10 levels.

* You now select a background when starting a game, the choices are "Occultist" (magic), "Rogue" (stealth), and "War Veteran" (fighter/firearms) - Your background determines which traits and items you start with, there are also special background-specific abilities, and some traits have background prerequisites.

* You now gain half a monsters worth of experience when spotting it, and the other half when killing it (killing a monster without spotting it gives the full worth)

* You can now "become aware" of a monster by hearing or seeing it - this "awareness" will last for a few turns and cause the monster to be marked on the map with an exclamation mark ("!") while it is not in your view. This represents the player character listening more closely for footsteps and other small clues, and estimating where the monster could go. This feature is intended to help avoid situations like walking around a corner to get instantly killed by a shotgun blast - now you should have more opportunity to make better decisions about such things.

* Objects on the map are no longer interacted with through popup menus (which were considered slow and boring). Instead you use the standard keyboard commands listed in the manual - such as [d] for disarming traps, or [q] for bashing something. The examine command [a] is now merely used for searching an object (for traps). Bumping an object will attempt to use it in the normal way (opening a chest, drinking from a fountain, descending the stairs, reading the inscriptions on the graves in the forest level, etc).

* Bashing now works in a more general way. You can attempt to find secret doors by bashing on any wall. You can destroy corpses by bashing them. Bashing/kicking now always consumes a turn, whether you hit something or not ("I kick the air!"). When attempting to kick in a cell with an unseen monster (due to blindness or monster hiding), it will behave in the same way as normal melee attacks ("I kick it") - this fixes a bug where an attempt to kick an unseen monster had no effect

* Reworked Strange Devices. Now instead of keeping them enabled for random occasional effects, you activate them for an instant effect. They can be activated multiple times, although their condition may degrade, and they can malfunction or break. The effects of some of the Devices have been reworked as well. The result of these changes is that the Devices should now be more effective and fun to use. Also, they are more common now, and you can even find them on the first dungeon level.

* Your insanity no longer rises immediately when shock is at 100% or more, instead you now first have three turns with warning messages - during these turns you have a chance to reduce shock below 100% (e.g. by turning on a light in a dark room, drinking a Potion of Fortitude, descending the stairs, or stepping away from a ghoulish statue)

* Added sound effects for melee attacks, spellcasting, dying, and opening tombs - also added more ambient sounds
* The game now prompts for confirmation when attempting to cast an intrinsic spell which could potentially deplete your Spirit
* Greatly reduced duration of Weakening
* Greatly reduced duration of Disease when received from fountains, tombs, and spells (disease will only last a very long time when received from infections)
* You are now immune to Infection while Diseased (being Infected and Diseased at the same time was redundant and annoying)
* Added "Manuscript of Darkbolt", this is similar to "Azathoths Wrath", but targets only one monster and costs less spirit to cast intrinsically - selecting the background "Occultist" guarantees starting with this spell
* Added spell "Mi-Go hypnosis", available for all monsters (but not the player) - all Mi-Go (Fungi from Yuggoth) know this spell - when this is cast, there is a chance that you will faint for a few turns
* Added a spell available only for monsters, which causes the player to burn for a few turns
* Changed "Manuscript of Clairvoyance" to a Potion, and instead of continuously revealing monsters and dungeon layout around you, it now instantly reveals the layout of the whole level (including items, but not monsters)
* Added "Manuscript of Detect Monsters", which marks all unseen monsters on the map with an exclamation mark for a number of turns (no shock taken from these detected monsters)
* Added "Manuscript of Elemental Resistance", which gives you temporary resistance to fire, cold, and electricity
* Manuscript of Pestilence no longer spawns dozens of monsters - it is now a more reasonable number
* Quaffing Potions of Health/Spirit when already at max HP/SPI no longer raises your max values, instead they can now temporarily raise your current HP/SPI above the max values
* Reduced the number of vertical map cells
* Added two common monsters (Flying Polyps, Chthonians), and one unique monster
* Added Golden Fountains, which are guaranteed to have a positive effect
* Hearing sounds no longer aborts multi-turn actions (such as healing)
* Reduced the propagation range of sounds (especially loud sounds like pistol fire)
* Added natural fear and confusion resistance for various monsters (e.g. Ooze-types, Spirit-types)
* Knockback no longer cause confusion
* Added a message that tells you when a monster spots you and becomes aware of you
* More sensible rules for where stairs can spawn, and where player descends on the next level
* Reduced number of turns waited when pressing [s] from 10 to 5
* Removed the message "was that supposed to do something?" when reading scrolls with no apparent effect
* The trait "Observant" no longer makes you find clues about hidden doors (was represented by a yellow wall) - instead this trait simply raises your chance of finding doors, and allows you to spot them from two cells away (another trait "Perceptive" raises the distance to three cells)
* Mummies now generally spawn alone instead of in groups
* Removed "Mythos knowledge", and removed the spell you gained at a certain level of MTH
* You can now disarm traps by pressing [d] and choosing a direction (works both for traps on the ground and on chests)
* When the electric lantern is flickering, it now merely reduces the lit area to 3x3 cells, it can still also malfunction and fail to give any light, or break completely
* When encumbered there is now an interval between 100-125% where you are able to move at half speed - at 125% and above you are completely immobile
* Added messages when your Spirit is being drained (e.g. by Ghosts)
* The postmortem information no longer lists number of kills for each type of monster, instead it only lists unique monsters killed, and the total number of monsters
* Masochistic Obsession no longer restores shock when player is damaged, it now merely removes the shock normally taken when damaged (and raises minimum shock to 35%)

Interface
* The game now supports Vi-keys
* You can no longer select things in menus by pressing letter keys
* To make it easier to notice when shocking events happen, exclamation marks ("!") are now drawn on the player character if enough shock is received during a turn (up to three marks can be drawn)
* There is now two lines for displaying messages - significantly reducing the number of "--More--" prompts.
* Some important messages are now colored orange, and some of these messages always trigger a "--More--" prompt (for example spotting traps and monsters), making them easier to notice and react to
* Item symbols are now drawn in the inventory screen and the wielding info at the bottom of the screen
* Changed the appearance of the main menu and character creation screens
* Removed the option to scale the font to 2x size
* Added a 16x24 DOS font
* Added option for how tiles mode should render walls - full square or pseudo-3D
* The game now handles delays in a nicer way. Previously, a delay would freeze the whole program. So for example while a projectile was travelling, the game could appear frozen (especially noticeable if setting a long delay). Now user input is read during delays so the game is not freezing - you can move the screen, alt-tab back and forth, minimize etc.
* The screen is now redrawn when toggling fullscreen (previously the screen would be black until you entered a command)
* Popup windows with multiple choices (e.g. the medical bag menu) can be closed with space or escape
* The options menu is now accessible from within an ongoing game
* Pressing [x] re-casts previous spell, and pressing [X] (uppercase) opens the list of all memorized spells
* Added an in-game menu opened with [Esc], where you can select Options, Manual, Quit, or Cancel
* Removed commands [>] (descend stairs) and [S] (save and quit) - instead you now bump the stairs, which opens a menu asking if you want to Descend, Save and quit, or Cancel
* Changed command for viewing descriptions to [v] instead of [l] (lowercase L)
* Changed command for bashing/kicking to [q] instead of [b]
* Changed command for unloading/picking up ammo to [G] instead of [u]
* Changed the message log command to [m] instead of [L]
* When reloading, the amount of ammo loaded in the weapon is now printed in the log
* Some special ranged weapons now only show "*" (asterisk) as damage info (e.g. the Incinerator, which previously displayed "1d3" as damage - this only represented the "impact damage" of the shell, and did not include the explosion - the asterisk used now should give a clearer indication that the weapon will do damage in a special way)

Bug fixes
* Fixed many bugs related to saving/loading (e.g. crashing, losing memorized spells)
* Fixed many bugs related to properties (especially concerning properties which were supposed to be permanent, but would time out - e.g. confusion resistance gained from picking the trait "Self-aware")
* Corrected various spelling mistakes
* Fixed a bug that prevented Ooze-type monsters from passing through closed doors (they should be able to do this)
* Fixed a bug that prevented using Page Up/Page Down/Home/End for diagonal movement


--------------------------------------------------------------
v15.0 (November 26, 2013)
--------------------------------------------------------------
* Added sound effects (for weapons, monsters, etc) and atmospheric ambient background sounds. Audio can be enabled/disabled in the options menu.
* The track "Madness" by Musica Cthulhiana (from the album "Fragment") is used as intro music in the main menu
* Reworked the status effects system, and changed/added many effects. Internally, status effects are now called "Properties". They can describe both a creature's temporary conditions (confused, burning, diseased...) and permanent attributes (natural fire resistance, light sensitivity...). It is now also possible for items to apply properties on the wearer. Properties may prevent damage (e.g. fire resistance will prevent all fire damage).
* Removed the physical/mental status resistances (measured in percent). The reason is that they felt too dependant on luck - you could for example get confused many times even with high resistance. Now there are instead binary resistances (you are either completely immune, or completely susceptible), such as resistance to fear, confusion, sleep, etc. The "shock resistance" percentage is still kept however, since this simply reduces shock by a certain percent (no luck involved).
* Changed the spell casting system to use a mana-like resource called "Spirit", instead of the previous chance-based system. The reason for this is similar to the reason for removing physical/mental status resistances (mentioned above) - it was too unpredictable and luck dependant. Now it should be easier to make tactical decisions about spell casting.
* Being Confused now prevents spell casting
* All creatures have a certain amount of Spirit. If a creature's Spirit is depleted, it dies (monsters may sometimes attempt to cast a spell that could kill it, if it "feels desperate").
* Removed "Potion of the Cobra" (gave perfect aiming and dodging)
* Added "Potion of Frenzy" - Gives the property "Frenzied": Perfect melee aiming, cannot cast spells or read, resistance to confusion/sleep/fear/weakening, attempting to walk in any direction will cause you to step towards nearest visible monster, becomes weakened when effect ends.
* Added "Potion of Spirit" - Restores spirit
* Added "Potion of Fire Resistance"
* Added "Potion of Insulation" - Electricity resistance
* Added "Potion of Antidote" - Cures poisoning
* Removed "Manuscript of Identify"
* Renamed "Potion of Knowledge" to "Potion of Insight" - It now identifies a random carried item, as well as increasing Mythos knowledge like in previous versions
* Changed "Manuscript of Descent" to a potion
* Added "Manuscript of Sacrifice Life Force" - Convert remaining Hit Points to Spirit points
* Added "Manuscript of Sacrifice Spirit" - Convert remaining Spirit points to Hit Points
* The spell that you gain after reaching a certain level of Mythos knowledge ("Thaumaturgic Alteration"), now chooses effect automatically (instead of player selecting the effect from a menu), this can include a random manuscript-spell, or a special effect if the circumstances allow it.
* Renamed the spell "Azathoths Blast" to "Azathoths Wrath"
* Added armor "Asbestos Suit" - Wearing this gives you resistance to fire/acid/electricity. It has 1 armor point (physical damage protection and durability of the armor)
* Added armor "Heavy Coat" - Wearing this gives you resistance to cold. It has 1 armor point
* Bloated Corpse spit attack now does acid damage
* Added a few cold based monsters that does cold damage
* Hit points now automatically regenerates over time, although you can receive wounds that need many turns of active healing (similar to how HP were healed in previous versions, but more elaborate - see below). Each wound reduces your fighting abilities (especially melee) and your HP regeneration rate. If you have more than four wounds, you die.
* Added item "Medical Bag". This has a number of different uses, the main purpose is to heal wounds.
* The [h]eal command has been removed, instead you use the Medical Bag.
* When attacking ethereal monsters (e.g. Ghosts-type monsters), the attack will often fail to hit ("My attack passes right through the Ghost!"). In case of ranged attacks, the projectile will often pass through the monster and continue on its path, even if aiming succeeded.
* Shadow-type monsters are now light sensitive - they are harmed each turn a light shines on them (e.g. from a lantern, flare, or burning creature).
* Reworked leveling system: You now pick all your character's traits and skills at the start of the game instead of when gaining levels. Gaining a level now increases your hit points, and for some levels also attack skills, dodging, spirit points and mythos knowledge.
* Merged/changed/added some traits and skills
* The formulas determining XP needed per level, and XP given per monster are completely remade.
* A monster's chance of spotting you is now affected by distance.
* Added fountains that you can drink from for various effects
* Some dungeon features can now spawn more freely on the map, as well as in themed rooms. Some room themes are also made less obvious now, and their label has been removed from the bottom of the screen. The reason for this is that in the previous version some themed rooms got very repetitive (e.g. too many levels had identical human quarters with a chest, cabinet, and some Cultists).
* Added a simple animated effect for summoned monsters and for creatures hit by spells
* You no longer automatically reload your weapon when attempting to fire an empty gun (though there is a setting in the options menu to enable this again). The reason is that it was too easy to reload by accident.
* Fixed a typo that said "Press 'v'" when you tried to throw a missile with empty missile slot. Changed it to say "Press 'w'", which is the actual command to equip items.
* Fixed a bug that prevented you from using melee attacks on a turn that you had a free move from the "Dextrous" bonus, and walked in liquid
* Fixed a bug where carrying multiple electric lanterns prevented you from using any other than the top one


--------------------------------------------------------------
v14.1 (June 16, 2013)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Miscellaneous
* Using SDL for rendering/input again (it seems more compatible with a wider range of systems)
* Dark areas now have less permissive field of view for spotting walls, previously it was easy to explore the walls in dark areas, whereas now you need to be adjacent to it - for a more atmospheric and oppressive feeling
* "Slimy" walls are now "Moss-grown" walls instead
* Added 15 more quotes to the main menu

New content and features
* Hit chance with ranged weapons is now affected by the size, speed and proximity of the target creature
* While aiming, you are informed what you are looking at, and hit chances are shown when aiming at monsters
* Monsters now avoid shooting each other (though there is still a small chance that it happens)

Balancing
* You no longer pick an ability when creating a new character
* The monster spawn rate on explored levels (spawning due to passage of time) is now lower
* The "Self-aware" bonus now has "Observant" as an additional prerequisite
* You now gain the mythos spell at 15% MTH instead of 10%
* Raised max character level from 21 to 30
* Greatly reduced duration of confusion caused by knockback
* Oozes now regenerate HP each standard turn instead of on their own turn (since these monsters are very slow, their regeneration occurred in bursts, which seemed erratic and unpredictable)
* Clear Oozes are somewhat easier to spot

Usability
* Floor cells lit by an Electric lantern, flare, burning creature, etc are now marked with yellow color
* The menu for picking a new ability also shows previously picked abilities
* The postmortem info shows gained abilities
* Renamed the manual to a .txt file, and removed all special formatting symbols from it - it should now be conveniently readable externally
* Changed texts in some screens (e.g. "Enter character name" -> "What is your name?")
* Changed equipment screen command (wear, wield) from 'v' to 'w' (more traditional/intuitive key)
* Added a small delay per turn when waiting/healing/fainted/paralyzed
* Changed the "Kick/bash in what direction?" message to simply "Which direction?", and vice versa for other actions
* Options for setting keyboard repeat delay and interval

Graphics
* Made layout changes to the main menu
* Made some changes to the wall tiles
* Changed the general color theme in the game - the "blood red" style has been changed to a teal style (inspired by how certain old black and white movies were tinted, e.g. Nosferatu)
* Added option to scale the font to 2x size (so you can for example use the small DOS-like font scaled up to a nice readable size) - if tiles mode is enabled, the scaled font must match the tile size
* Fullscreen can be toggled in the options menu, or by pressing alt-enter (fullscreen mode is highly experimental, it may or may not work for you)

Bug fixes
* Corrected a spelling error in an ability description
* Corrected a misplaced word in a monster description


--------------------------------------------------------------
v14.0 (April 23, 2013)
--------------------------------------------------------------
New content and features
* Changed API from SDL to SFML - The game should run much smoother on most systems
* New inventory system which is easier to use, and requires much fewer keyboard commands to learn
* Inventory items are color coded and sorted according to item type and name
* New skill system - Instead of ranks there are separate abilities, each with their own name. Some abilities have prerequisites
* In-game options menu
* Some features in the game can be examined (by pressing [a]), to be interacted with in various ways - this includes tombs, cocoons, chests and cabinets
* Added a new trait called "Mythos knowledge" (MTH) - this determines your insight about the mystical and hidden forces - increases damage dealt to all bizarre, alien, mystical and shocking creatures - raises spell casting chance - at a certain level of MTH, you gain a powerful spell
* Monsters can trigger traps, and you can kick monsters into traps
* New spell casting system
* Changed the way monsters cause shock. Previously you would take a big hit on the first turn that you see the monster, then smaller hits for each turn. Now the shock taken starts at 0 instead, and increases slowly. This gives more opportunity to retreat, or to take down the monsters swiftly before taking too much shock.
* The player character and monsters have a life bar (only visible while wounded)
* The searching skill (now called "Observant") no longer increases your chance of finding a secret door, instead if gives a chance to mark walls (you find a clue about a secret passage)
* Added more monsters
* Added "Strange devices" - a new item type which causes various positive effects to occur while active, but may malfunction or break
* Added "Electric Lantern" - lights up darkness while activate, but may flicker, malfunction or break
* Added "Potion of Sorcery" - sets casting chance for all learned spells to 100%
* Added "Potion of Knowledge" - increases Mythos knowledge
* Added "Manuscript of Azathoth's Blast" - damages and paralyzes all visible creatures
* Added "Manuscript of Identify" - identifies a random unknown item in your inventory
* Added "Manuscript of Opening" - opens all doors, chests etc around you
* Changed "Potion of Clairvoyance" to a manuscript, and gave it a new effect
* Merged all manuscripts that casts negative status effects into "Manuscript of Enfeeble Enemies"
* Added an alarm trap
* Added a monster summoning trap
* Added status effect "Weak" - melee attacks does minimum damage, decreased carry weight limit, cannot bash doors, lower physical status resistance, and other effects
* Improved postmortem/memorial information - Removed the decorative graveyard from the intro level, instead there are gravestones scattered along the path to the church. These graves represent the top highscore entries, and have inscriptions that can be read using the [l]ook command. Added date and time to the highscore entries and graves. Postmortem info is always kept (in text files with character name and timestamp)
* Iron spikes can also be used as (bad) thrown weapons
* Flares light up a circular area of darkness (the flare's field of view), instead of lighting up the whole room
* Carrying a lit flare lights up darkness around you, and you can walk around and fight while holding it
* Burning monsters lights up a small area of darkness around them
* Most non-human monsters can now see in darkness
* If becoming paralyzed while holding a lit Dynamite, Molotov cocktail or Flare, it will be dropped (if it's a Molotov, it will explode when it hits the ground)
* Ranged weapons spawned on the floor have random amounts of ammo loaded, instead of always full
* Hitting a monster with a medium or heavy melee weapon now makes noise (alerting other monsters)
* Reloading while blind or terrified risks fumbling and wasting the turn
* If healing is aborted, you are partially healed (if a minimum number of turns have passed)
* Added phrases for many monsters ("I hear the flapping of great wings", "I hear a gurgling noise", etc)
* If you wield a machete and step into a spider web, you will instantly cut down the web
* A monster shot with a flare will take damage each turn, and may eventually catch fire (instead of exploding in flames on death)
* Rewritten shotgun code - Now, if the shot hits a human sized creature and the shot is lethal, it may also hit a second creature standing directly behind the first
* After a certain dungeon level, dart and spear traps can be poisoned
* Attacking unarmed causes a punch-attack

Graphics
* Nicer looking main menu, with a new logo (thanks to Agata Skrzypczyk)
* The Windows version has an icon (thanks to Agata Skrzypczyk)
* Added "clean" 16x24 font for tiles and ASCII mode, and made it default
* The typewriter font is fully available for ASCII mode
* Shadows have a new tile, and there are new tiles for new features, items and monsters (thanks to Christopher Barrett, aka Oryx)
* Added a new cave wall tile and general trap tile (thanks to Christopher Barrett, aka Oryx)
* Added new magical trap tile (thanks to Agata Skrzypczyk)
* The popup boxes have new border graphics (thanks to Christopher Barrett, aka Oryx), and the box and text layout is much nicer looking
* Unaware monsters have blue backgrounds instead of a blue underscore
* Added a secondary wall tile occasionally used as alternative (purely aesthetical)
* Added an atmospheric fade effect to the field of view - further cells are rendered darker (monsters are always drawn at full brightness though)

Balancing
* Made changes to the AI to make it act less irrational and more aggressive, in particular it won't run back and forth between melee attacks or pass attack opportunities as much as in the previous version
* Made non-player aware monsters skip every second turn (they don't move at full speed if nothing exciting is happening), this makes stealth tactics more powerful, and it looks cool when they discover you and start moving fast
* Becoming aware of the player by looking counts as an action for monsters (to give the monsters some reaction time instead of attacking instantly), though you may still be gunned down instantly if you alert the monsters beforehand (e.g. by making noise)
* Melee-attacking a creature who is unaware, fainted, paralyzed, or stuck has a very high hit chance bonus - melee-attacking a creature who is blind, confused, slowed or burning has a moderate hit chance bonus
* While paralyzed, additional paralyzing effects are prevented (creatures with such an attack could very easily paralyze you permanently)
* Knockback causes confusion
* Sadistic/Masochistic obsessions makes shock unable to go below a certain percent (instead of increasing the shock rate)
* Taking damage causes a small amount of shock (if not masochistic)
* The Incinerator (Napalm launcher) now use clips (3 rounds) instead of single shots

Usability
* Added titles to most popups
* Character info screen (accessed with [@]) gives more info - combat stats, resistances, item knowledge
* Reading/drinking an unknown manuscript/potion and failing to identify it adds {tried} to the name
* The name of your currently wielded weapon and missile weapon is shown in the interface
* Melee damage is no longer shown in the interface for ranged weapons, and vice versa
* When [l]ooking at a weapon on the ground, damage, hit chance and loaded ammo is displayed
* Phobia effects no longer occur while healing (it could cause huge number of queries for canceling healing)
* Messages about status effects ending no longer queries for canceling healing
* Unload command also works for picking up ammo (convenient when you want to get all the ammo dropped from a monster, but not the gun)
* Merged bash and kick to one command, [b]
* Esc and space also works as "no" for all y/n prompts
* Esc works as alternative quit command (same as [Q])
* Attacking a monster in melee with a ranged weapon causes a warning prompt (can be turned off in the options menu)
* Armor disappears when dropping to 0 protection value
* Disease temporarily lowers your maximum HP, instead of making you rapidly lose HP down to a certain limit (with the old method it was always possible to heal yourself, even though it was useless)
* Removed some useless attack messages ("I fumble", "It was a great hit!!!")

Miscellaneous
* Removed kill count info from the look screen, and added it to the postmortem info instead, as well as showing the total number of kills
* Removed support for multiple save files
* Switched colors of gas traps and teleport traps, gas traps are now magenta and teleport traps are cyan

Bug fixes
* Nuclear batteries occasionally spawned with the wrong weight (reported by Surrealistik)
* Turn number is now stored in the save file


--------------------------------------------------------------
v13.1 (September 20, 2012)
--------------------------------------------------------------
* The Incinerator is a medium weight weapon
* The Toughness ability also gives a hit point bonus
* Lowered starting hit points from 16 to 14
* Fixed: There was a situation that put the game in an infinite loop (not responding)
* Fixed: The player color updates immediately after healing (instead of the turn after)


--------------------------------------------------------------
v13.0 (September 15, 2012)
--------------------------------------------------------------
* The narrative is in first person perspective
* Added new 16x24 font (typewriter)
* Nicer looking main menu
* Removed the "Arcana" skill, and added a different system for casting chance
* Items have weights, and there is a carry limit
* Improved hit chances of heavy weapons to compensate for their weight
* Thrown items makes sounds when hitting hard surfaces

--------------------------------------------------------------
Old changelogs from before the game was named Infra Arcana
--------------------------------------------------------------
Feb 7, 2011
* There are incantation scrolls with mysterious titles that you can read. Their effect and true identity are unknown until you try them (and only if their effect is visible and obvious to the player character). Once you learn the true identity of a scroll, all scrolls of that type are always known. There are a decent number of types in the game already.
* Items are found in the dungeon (not only dropped from killed monsters).
* New skill: Dodge & Evade.
* New items: More melee weapons. Healing items.
* Dynamite explodes in your hands if you hold it too long.
* Corpses blow up from explosions (can be used to prevent zombies from rising).
* New enemy: Wolf.
* Firearms on the ground have white symbol if they have ammo loaded, otherwise gray.
* Projectile symbol depends on direction fired (used to be '/' for all directions).
* Identical log messages show number of repeats, instead of repeating the message itself.
Before: You are hit. You are hit. You are hit.
Now: "You are hit.(x3)"
* The log prompts for "[MORE]" if next message doesn't fit.
* Added several log messages related to throwing, dynamite fuse, death screams from explosions and other things.
"You light a dynamite stick. You throw a lit dynamite stick. (E)You hear an explosion. (E)You hear agonized screaming(x4)"
* Picking up items, lighting dynamite fuse and throwing now costs turns.
* New inventory interface. It takes fewer key-presses to use now.

Dec 1, 2010
* Big rearrangement of the interface.
* In-game command list.
* Monsters sometimes drop stuff when they die.
* One item per tile. Items dropped on other items "roll" to the nearest free cell. This creates a nice "explosion"-effect when monsters die.
* Message when you stand on an item.
* Command for unloading ammo from a gun on the ground ('u').
* Pressing the fire command when no ammo loaded attempts a reload instead.
(Especially handy with Shotguns.)
* The interface always shows info for the wielded weapon both as a firearm and as a melee weapon.
* Staircases cannot be hidden by corpses.

Nov 23, 2010
* Smarter AI
> Some monsters will search for you if they saw you.
> Some will listen for sounds.
> Some will communicate about where to search.
* Corpses/Gore (depending on force of attack)
* Zombie-corpses can rise again.
* Napalm Launcher explosion also sets creatures on fire.
* Blindness affects messages - "It bites you!", "You hear gunfire." et c
* Blindness affects skill rolls.
* Added some nice things to the forest-level
> Crypt that you climb out of.
> Graveyard.
> You reach the dungeon/underworld through the cellar of a ruined church.
* Predefined rooms that appear randomly.
* Fixed a graphical glitch with Tommy Gun and Tesla Cannon.
* Various balancing/behaviour fixing.
* Fixed some problems with keyboard input and the game directory

Oct 5, 2010
* New weapons - Tesla Canon, Tommy Gun
* New enemies - Fanatic, Zealot
* Player visual memory - Things outside your field of view are seen as your character remembers them.
* Merged Firearm-slot and Melee-slot - Instead of two separate slots, you have "Wielding". Firearms can also be used in melee to buttstroke enemies.

Sep 19, 2010
* Gargoyle - I'm happy with the behaviour of this one. It's much faster than you when moving, but when it swoops down to claw at you it must pause for a short while. The gargoyle can also fling bones.
* Napalm launcher - Hehehe
* Monsters are placed in groups at world generation - Now you can be chased by a horde of zombies.
* Characters have size data. Ranged attacks have rules for what character sizes can be hit - resulting in more intuitive behaviour such as:
> A rat can't block your shot when you aim at a human-sized target.
> Projectiles can miss their target and hit someone behind it instead.
> You can aim the Napalm Launcher at the ground.

Aug 25, 2010
* Dynamite
You can light the fuse, and you can wait with the lit dynamite in hands if you want. When you throw it, it can bounce off walls. When the fuse runs out the dynamite explodes for massive area damage.
* Reloading
The shotgun has a capacity of two shells, and you load one shell at a time. Cultits reload their shotgun when they need to.
* Phantasm
When it goes ethereal you can't attack it, and vice versa. It can slice you with its sickle. It can also use the sickle to project evil spirits at you, though it prefers melee.
